# Using-Dominating-Sets-to-Block-Contagions-in-Social-Networks

# Network Contagion Blocking Strategy

This project implements a network analysis to study the spread of contagion in a social network and evaluates a strategy to block this spread using dominating sets. The implementation is done in Python and utilizes libraries like NetworkX for network creation and manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python (preferably version 3.8 or later)
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas

You can install these packages using pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy pandas

### Running the Script
Clone the Repository: First, clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your directory to where the script is located.
`` bash
cd path/to/project

Execute the Script: Run the Python script using the Python interpreter.
``bash
python contagion_network_analysis.py
Replace contagion_network_analysis.py with the actual name of the Python script.

View Results: The script will perform the network generation, contagion simulation, blocking strategy application, and comparative analysis. It will output the results to the console and save detailed data to a CSV file. Additionally, it will display visualizations of the network contagion spread.
