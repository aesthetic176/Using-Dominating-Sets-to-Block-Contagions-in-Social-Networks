# Network Contagion Blocking Strategy

This project implements a network analysis to study the spread of contagion in a social network and evaluates a strategy to block this spread using dominating sets. The implementation is done in Python and utilizes libraries like NetworkX for network creation and manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python (preferably version 3.8 or later)
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas

You can install these packages using pip. Run the following command:
```bash
